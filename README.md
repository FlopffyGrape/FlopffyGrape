### Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹
- I'm a senior middle school student, mid-level Python and C++ programmer. I'm also a Vietnamese/English translator of some repos(Although my English skill is not really really good).

- My favorite job is contributing repos on Github.

- At this time, I'm being slowed down my computing work because of the preparation of the entrance examination next year... I won't be active usually.
